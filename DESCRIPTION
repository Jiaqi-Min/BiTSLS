Description: Implements bidirectional two-stage least squares (Bi-TSLS) estimation 
    for identifying bidirectional causal effects between two variables 
    in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The method uses proxy 
    variables (negative control exposure and outcome) along with 
    at least one covariate to handle confounding.
